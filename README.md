### 2.2 Component Interaction
1. Client sends a message to the API Gateway
2. API Gateway routes the request to the Conversation Service
3. Conversation Service uses NLP Service for intent classification
4. Knowledge Base Service is queried for appropriate response
5. History Service logs the interaction
6. Response is sent back through the API Gateway to the client
