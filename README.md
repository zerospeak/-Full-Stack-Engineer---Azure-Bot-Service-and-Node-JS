  <summary># Support Bot End User Testing Guide</summary>

Here's a step-by-step guide for testing the Support Bot application from an end user perspective:

## Prerequisites
1. Ensure MongoDB is running locally
2. Ensure Redis is running locally
3. Make sure the application is built and running

## Step 1: Start the Application
```bash
cd c:\Users\leero\source\repos\support-bot-capstone
npm run dev
```

## Step 2: Access the Chat Interface
1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3978
3. You should see the Customer Support Bot interface with a welcome message

## Step 3: Basic Conversation Testing
1. **Test basic greeting**
   - Type: "Hello"
   - Expected: Bot should respond with a greeting

2. **Test password reset intent**
   - Type: "I need to reset my password"
   - Expected: Bot should provide password reset instructions

3. **Test account creation intent**
   - Type: "How do I create an account?"
   - Expected: Bot should provide account creation information

4. **Test product information intent**
   - Type: "Tell me about your products"
   - Expected: Bot should provide product information

## Step 4: Test Error Handling
1. **Test empty message**
   - Send an empty message
   - Expected: Bot should ask for clarification

2. **Test very short message**
   - Type: "Hi"
   - Expected: Bot should ask for more details

3. **Test unknown intent**
   - Type: "xyzabc123"
   - Expected: Bot should respond that it doesn't understand

## Step 5: Test Multi-turn Conversation
1. **Start with a general question**
   - Type: "I have a problem with my order"
   - Expected: Bot should ask for more details

2. **Provide order details**
   - Type: "My order #12345 hasn't arrived"
   - Expected: Bot should acknowledge the order number and provide shipping information

## Step 6: Verify Conversation History
1. Run the MongoDB structure script to check if conversations are being saved:
```bash
cd c:\Users\leero\source\repos\support-bot-capstone
node scripts\show-mongodb-structure.js
```
2. Check for the "messages" collection and verify your conversation appears

## Step 7: Test Session Management
1. Close the browser and reopen it
2. Navigate back to http://localhost:3978
3. Start a new conversation
4. Run the Redis structure script to verify session data:
```bash
node scripts\show-redis-structure.js
```

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting
- If the bot doesn't respond, check the console for errors
- If MongoDB connection fails, ensure MongoDB is running on the default port
- If Redis connection fails, ensure Redis server is active

This testing guide covers the basic functionality of the Support Bot. Document any unexpected behaviors or issues encountered during testing.
